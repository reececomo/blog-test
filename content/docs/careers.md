## Culture

#### Our Home Away From Home

- **Innovation** - No DOS here. Technology first movers.
- **Collaboration** - Three heads are better than one. Team effort.
- **Freedom** - Bring your ideas, goals and brainfarts. Create away.
- **Praise** - Snaps for bringing your A-game. And cake for winning!
- **Inclusion** - Fit ball, sofa, stool or desk. A place for all bums (and quirks).
- **Fun** - Mondays suck less when you're doing what you love.
